A Discord bot to manage multiplayer game servers. A replacement for valheim-maintenance-bot, since the code no longer works out of the box (deprecated dependencies). Rather than fixing it, I decided to rewrite it in Rust, but make it more generic to support more than one game. I will start with Valheim and Minecraft.
